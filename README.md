# Eolymp Project

This project belongs to the Eolymp social network project, a open network for athletes created
by researchers at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and supported by the Microsoft® Pre-Incubation Program
and ChampionChip.cat, the leader in timing races in Catalonia.

Actually, Eolymp has its own web page, which represents the athletes social network. The point is that more and more
the people are accessing the contents via smartphones app instead via web page, due this behavior Eolym wants a multiplatform
app for smartphones.

The mission of my degree final project was to develop a multiplatform app prototype for smartphones using Xamarin Studio.
